This repository holds the codes to my major projects

The first project PRETTY VIEW is a python package containing two functions.
From observation I realised not everyone is python savvy and also as developers and
data scientists it's always kinda boring or overwhelming(if you're noob) having to put in
quite a chunck of code and time just to get some simple multiple regression done.
In view of this the thought of having something like "pretty view" came in mind.

Can't I just put together all these lines once and for all so I don't have 
to do it all over again everytime I have a different dataset?
And that is how PRETTY VIEW was born.
With pretty_view all you need to do is to pass the dataset as an argument to the function
and you get your regression coefficients, standard deviation, confidence interval, R-squared, 
MSE, RMSE and the constant term. And the most exciting part is you could get all these with just
two to three lines of code. pretty_view does the rest of the work.

Someone might ask, why 'PRETTY VIEW'? Well, it's called pretty view simply because
I feel the output is pretty cool :-)

I deem pretty_view a work in progress and ever ready to collaborate with anyone willing 
to help perfect it.
