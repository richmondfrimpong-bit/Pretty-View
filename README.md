# Pretty View

## Overview
This project entails a .py source file containing two functions.
The purpose of these functions is to enable people who are not python 
savvy to utilise the scikit-learn linear regression module in running 
multiple linear regression.
With these functions all the user has to do is to pass the dataset as an
argument to the function and everything else is taken care of.
The user in return gets as an output the regression coefficients, intercept (constant),
Standard deviation, confidence interval (95%), and metric such as R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Relative Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and also info on the split such as the train and test data.
Because else is carried out in the background by the functions, a user may just need two to three lines of 
code to get the job done.

Below are the respective docstrings to the functions:
